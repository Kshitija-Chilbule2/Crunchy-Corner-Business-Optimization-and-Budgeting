## Business Metrics
### 1. Total Number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units): 
A unique code given to each product by businesses to help track inventory and manage orders. Crunchy Corner holds the distinction of having the largest SKU variety in the industry.

### 2. COGS(Cost of Goods Sold): 
COGS represents the direct costs a company pays to make the products it sells, such as raw materials, labor, and production costs. It is subtracted from total sales to find out how much profit the company makes from selling its goods.

### 3. Gross Profit (GP): 
Gross Profit is the money a company makes from selling its products after subtracting the cost of making those products (COGS). It shows how efficiently the company is producing and selling its goods. Gross Profit is calculated by subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Net Revenue.

GP=Net Revenueâˆ’COGS

### 4. Net Revenue:

**Formula:**
EBITDA=Gross Profitâˆ’Operating Expenses

### 6. PAT (Profit After Tax): 
PAT is the final profit figure, showing the earnings available to the shareholders. It is derived by subtracting all non-operating expenses (such as taxes, interest, and depreciation) from EBITDA.

**Formula:**
PAT=EBITDAâˆ’Interestâˆ’Taxesâˆ’Depreciation and Amortization
